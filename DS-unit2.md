Arrays and Hash Tables
Concept of sequential organization:
                                                    	The physical order in which the records are placed in the file determines the sequence of records. The relationships among records in the file do not change, except that the file can be extended. There are no keys. Both database files and device files can have sequential organization.
Each record in the file, except the first, has a unique predecessor record, and each record, except the last, also has a unique successor record.


Difference between Linear and Non-linear Data Structures:
Linear Data Structure:
Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in what is called a linear data structure. In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only. Linear data structures are easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way. Its examples are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
Non-linear Data Structure:
Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are trees and graphs.
